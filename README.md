<h1>Exchange Agency</h1>

<p> 
This project is a landing page for a (fictional) company that acts as an exchange agency. The goal is to demonstrate all my skills with HTML, CSS and Javascript. The landing page is extremely beautiful, organized, has a modern layout and, above all, is responsive and the use of SwiperJS made it even more visually interesting.
